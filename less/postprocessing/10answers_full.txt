1: What happens to you if you eat watermelon seeds? 
As an AI, I don't have a physical body, so I don't eat watermelon seeds or any other food items. However, I can provide information about the potential effects of eating watermelon seeds.

Watermelon seeds contain a high amount of volatile compounds, particularly citral and limonene, which can cause unpleasant odors and taste if ingested in large quantities. Some people may experience a burning sensation in their mouth or throat if they eat watermelon seeds in large quantities. Additionally, the seeds contain a small amount of a glycoside called citral glycoside, which can cause stomach upset and nausea if ingested in large quantities.

It is important to note that watermelon seeds are not toxic and are safe to eat in moderation. However, if you are concerned about the potential effects of eating watermelon seeds, it is always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian for personalized advice.
