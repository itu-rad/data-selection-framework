Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Describe the structure of an atom.

### Response: 
An atom is the smallest unit of ordinary matter that forms a chemical element. It consists of a nucleus, which contains the protons and neutrons, and electrons that orbit around the nucleus. In a neutral atom, the number of protons in the nucleus is equal to the number of electrons in the atom, resulting in a net charge of zero. The arrangement of protons, neutrons, and electrons in the atom is called the atomic structure.

The nucleus of an atom is located at the center and is made up of protons and neutrons. Protons are positively charged subatomic particles found in the nucleus and have a positive charge, while neutrons are neutral subatomic particles and have no charge. The number of protons in the nucleus determines the identity of an element, with each element having a unique number of protons in its atoms.

Electrons are negatively charged subatomic particles that orbit around the nucleus. The number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protons, and this number determines the chemical properties of an element. The arrangement of electrons in the orbitals of the atom is called the electron configuration.

In summary, an atom consists of a nucleus, which contains protons and neutrons, and a number of electrons that orbit around the nucleus, resulting in a neutral atom. The arrangement of protons and electrons in the atom determines the chemical properties of an element.
